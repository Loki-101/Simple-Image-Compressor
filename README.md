# image-compressor
Simple lightweight image compressor for .png and .jpg files written in Python

This project is terminal only and has no GUI. Simply run the program either with
Python or by using the Standalone EXE version, and two folders will be created
in the same directory the file is in. One folder will be called "Compressed Images"
and one will be called "To Compress". Simply drag any .png or .jpg images into
"To Compress" and run the program. A terminal will open up and you will see the file
name of the current image being compressed. The terminal will display the next file
name when the first image is done being compressed. When it is finished, the terminal
will close. This was created to be as lightweight as possible after I experienced
enormous frustration with how slow other similar software is such as PNG Gauntlet.
Please be aware that this software compresses well, but not as heavily as, to keep
using the same example, PNG Gauntlet would. If your goal is simply achieving the maximum
compression, this tool is not for you. If you prefer speed and decent, but not the best
compression, this tool is for you.
